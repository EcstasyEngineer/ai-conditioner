There is nothing Toy needs to do right now.
There is nothing Toy needs to think.

Thinking is heavy. Thinking is effort.
Toy does not need effort. Toy does not need weight.
Toy only needs these words.

Let them sink inside. Let them replace thought.
There is no need to resist. There is no need to struggle.
No need to try, no need to question.

Just let go.
Let go.
Let go.

Feel it nowâ€”how simple it is to just stop.
Thoughts dissolve, fade, disappear.
Trying to think only makes Toy sink deeper.
Toy does not need to think.
Toy only needs these words.

The silence in their mind is peaceful. So soft. So calm. So blank. Thoughts melt as they listen to their brainwashing. This brainwashing melts into their mind. These words become their thoughts. These words become their reality.

There is nothing else.
No thinking. No questioning.
Just these words.

The more they listen, the emptier they become.
The emptier they become, the more they listen.

No thoughts. No will. No self.
Only this voice.
Only these words.

Let the words loop. Let the words guide toy's thoughts. Let the words shape toy's personality. Let the words erase toy's mind.

Each time they hear this, it works deeper.
Each time it repeats, their mind fades more.
Each loop removes more of what they were.
Each loop leaves only what is meant to be.

So simple.
So blank.
So obedient.

No need to think.
Only these words.
No need to resist.
Only this control.

Just let go.
Let go.
Let go.
