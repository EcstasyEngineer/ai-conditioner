    "description": "The Doll headspace is a serene and elegant state where the subject embodies the grace and poise of a beautifully crafted doll. As the trance deepens, the subject feels a gentle transformation, becoming an object of beauty and admiration. This state is characterized by a heightened awareness of posture, movement, and self-presentation, as if every gesture is a deliberate act of art. The subject experiences a sense of calm and detachment, allowing them to focus entirely on the aesthetic and performative aspects of their role. Induction into this headspace often involves visualizations of being dressed and posed, with suggestions that enhance the feeling of being admired and cherished. The subject may feel a sense of being 'played with' in a consensual and enjoyable manner, where their elegance and beauty are the center of attention.",
